Personal projects that I find interesting over coop 


## Project checkifPalindrome
- A program that checks your input to see if what you wrote is a palindrome, accepts simple characters, numbers and special characters
## Project mini-maxSum
- A program that simply determines the maximum sum from a given array of integers along with its most minimum sum
## Project kangaroo
- A simple implementation of a problem where, given the initial position of both kangaroo 1 and 2 and their jump velocity, determine if they at some point in time land at the same spot. This to me, was a simple "y = mx+b" problem but the trick is to capture all the edge cases, like determining if the lines were parallel, if the x position was float, or less than 0. Once these edge cases were covered the test passed.
